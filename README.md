# MQTT Multiconnection Test
This project provides a test code of MQTT clients' multiple connections to a MQTT broker. It is helpful to test the number of connections and their stability. You can setup the number of MQTT clients and adjust the message transmission cycle. I hope this repository is helpful for your tests.
